# cm-metaStreet-challenge
Hello and welcome to my app

To start the app simply
- npm i
- npm run dev

This is a single page app that will connect to a users metamask in the browser and display all the NFTs in the wallet. The NFTs contain a link to their etherscan that will open the link in a new page when you click the address and the ID and address will appear on hover. If you select an NFT it will populate the Transfer NFT inputs with the relevant data, awaiting only the user to input the transfer-to address.

The app is Vite React TS with Sass Modules.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Connor
